Century No.70 
Score: 194 
Series: Bilateral test series, 2004 
Match: India V Pakistan, 1st test 
Venue: Multan 
Result: India won by an innings and 52 runs This was an out and out Sehwag match, which is why very few remember Sachin's performance in this historic clash. Many Indian teams had travelled to Pakistan over the years but none could actually inflict massive defeats on the Pakistanis. Sehwag scored his maiden triple century and Sachin 194 as India piled up 675 in their first innings. Sachin was actually unbeaten when captain Dravid decided to declare. There was a lot of hue and cry that followed. Many were unhappy with Dravid for not giving Sachin a chance to complete his double century.
