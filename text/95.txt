Century No.95 
Score: 214 
Series: Bilateral test series, 2010 
Match: India V Australia, 2nd test 
Venue: Bangalore 
Result: India won by 7 wickets What a masterly effort from the master blaster. This was the month when he was conferred the ICC Cricketer of the Year award for the year 2010. After an epic clash in the first test at Mohali, which India won by 1 wicket, the Chinnaswamy encounter was turning out to be another pulsating one. After conceding 478 in the first innings, India was in a spot of bother at 38 for 2 before Sachin played a magical knock. His 214 was laced with 22 fours and 2 sixes. In the end, Aussies were left wondering why even 478 was not enough to win a test!
