Century No.99 
Score: 111 
Series: World Cup 2011 
Match: India V South Africa, Group B 
Venue: Nagpur (Jamtha) 
Result: South Africa won by 3 wickets This was another occasion when India failed to capitalise on a great start provided by Sachin Tendulkar. Sehwag and Sachin had put on 142 for the opening wicket in just 17 overs. While that should have been platform enough to get a score of at least 325, India managed just 296 and went on to lose the match. Needless to say, Sachin's effort of 111 from 101 balls went in vain.
