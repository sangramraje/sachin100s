Result: India won by 37 runs India versus Australia was beginning to gain momentum ever since the two sides clashed in the World Cup final the same year in South Africa. In this clash, India had lost Sehwag in the very first over to Nathan Bracken. Sachin and Laxman then steadied the ship with a 190-run partnership for the second wicket. Both batsmen got centuries and helped India reach a commanding 283 from their 50 overs. Australia was in the hunt with Gilchrist getting a quickfire 83 but once he departed, it was India all the way. Sachin also picked up a wicket.
