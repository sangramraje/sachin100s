Score: 113 
Series: 2002 Tri-series in England featuring India, England and Sri Lanka 
Match: India V Sri Lanka, 9th match of the tournament 
Venue: 
Result: India won by 63 runs Barely a week after he caressed English bowlers at Chester-le-Street, Sachin was in ominous touch again. This time, it was against the Lankans. He smashed 113 off just 102 balls to help India surge past the 300-run mark and that did the trick. The Lankans did put up some resistance but it was a case of too-little-too-late from them.
