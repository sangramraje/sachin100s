Century No.71 
Score: 248 N.O. 
Series: Bilateral test series, 2004 
Match: India V Bangladesh, 1st test 
Venue: Dhaka 
Result: India won by an innings and 140 runs After a great tour down under exactly a year ago, India was increasingly establishing itself as world beaters not just at home but even on overseas surfaces. Bangladesh was always going to be easy meat for the red-hot Indian team. Expectedly, the series began in a one-sided manner. Bangladesh was bundled out for just 184 and Indian then piled on the misery with very good batting display. Sachin smashed an unbeaten 248 as the team scored 526 and pushed the local boys to the corner. Bangladesh was bundled out for just 202 in its second essay. Sachin's 248 came from nearly 10 hours and had 35 classy hits to the fence.
