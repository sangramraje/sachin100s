Century No.81 
Score: 117 N.O. 
Series: 2008 tri-series in Australia featuring India, Australia and Sri Lanka 
Match: 1st Final: India V Australia 
Venue: Sydney 
Result: India won by 6 wickets For all those who questioned Sachin's temperament on big occasions, this inning served as the perfect response from the little master. Chasing 240 to take a crucial lead in the best-of-three finals, Sachin played right through the chase to help India ease past the 240-mark with 4 overs remaining. The fact that Sachin's 117 only had 10 hits to the fence just shows how calculated his whole approach was.
