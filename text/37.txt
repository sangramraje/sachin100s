This was the match where Tendulkar famously tore Henry Olonga apart. The bowler had dismissed Sachin with a short delivery in a previous league game and Tendulkar had his revenge blasting the Zimbabwean all over the ground. With a ton in the final Tendulkar became the first batsmen to score twenty international tons.
