Century No.60 
Score: 117 
Series: Bilateral series, 2002 
Match: India V West Indies, 2nd test 
Venue: Port of Spain, Trinidad 
Result: India won by 37 runs India went in to the Caribbean series with serious hope after a decent tour of South Africa just the year before. They were getting closer and closer to getting rid of that tag of tigers only at home. This Indian team, under the leadership of Sourav Ganguly was gradually emerging as a fearless bunch on overseas soil. The first test at Guyana was drawn and India played their second test at one of their favourite venues in the West Indies, Port of Spain. Sachin's splendid century in the first innings took India to a reasonable 339. Although the West Indies won large parts of second innings, India emerged triumphant.
