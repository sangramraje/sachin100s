It was billed as a contest between Shane Warne and Sachin Tendulkar. The Australian leg spinner dismissed Sachin cheaply in the first innings, but in the second the Indian maestro made amends and took the spinner and Australian bowling apart. This Test match saw Sachin deflating Warne by hitting cross-bat shots to balls delivered outside the leg stump.
