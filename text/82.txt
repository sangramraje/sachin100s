Century No.82 
Score: 109 
Series: Border-Gavaskar Trophy, 2008 
Match: India V Australia, 4th test 
Venue: Nagpur (Jamtha) 
Result: India won by 172 runs For a change, it was a completely one-sided test series between India and Australia as the kangaroos struggled to cope with transition. Coming into the final test at Jamtha, Nagpur, India held a slender 1-0 lead and the Aussies were desperate to show there was life in them after all. Any hope the Aussies nourished was soon punctured when India notched up 441 in the first innings thanks to a great century by Sachin.
