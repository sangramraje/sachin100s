Century No.65 
Score: 152 
Series: World Cup 2003 
Match: India V Namibia, Pool A fixture 
Venue: Pietermaritzburg 
Result: India won by 181 runs India had come into this Pool A fixture after a drubbing only a week ago at the hands of defending champions Australia. Against Namibia, it was always going to be an easy outing for India but the question was how easy. The famous ODI combo of Sachin and Ganguly came to the party again with a stand of 244 for the second wicket (Sehwag had started opening by then). Sachin's 152 had 18 hits to the fence and interestingly none over it.
