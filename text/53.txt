Century No.53 
Score: 139 
Series: Bilateral ODI series, 2001 
Match: India V Australia, 3rd ODI 
Venue: Indore 
Result: India won by 118 runs After losing the second ODI at Pune by a fairly wide margin, India bounced back to take the lead at Indore's Nehru Stadium. Propelled by Sachin's 139 that came off just 125 balls with 19 fours, India amassed 299. That target was always going to be difficult for the Aussies, who folded up for just 181.
