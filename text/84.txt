Century No.84 
Score: 163 retired hurt 
Series: Bilateral ODI series, 2009 
Match: India V New Zealand, 3rd ODI 
Venue: Christchurch 
Result: India won by 58 runs AMI Stadium under lights always presents a fascinating sight to the eye and when someone like Sachin Tendulkar goes tearing apart the bowlers, it just adds to the glitz and excitement. Sachin was at his imperious best on the day and it was unfortunate he had to retire hurt on 163 with still 5 overs left. The world record and maybe even double hundred was within his sights. India made 392 and New Zealand played well but not well enough as they folded up for 334 in 45 overs.
