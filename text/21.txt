Century No. 21 
Score: 169 
Series: India in South Africa 1997, 2nd Test 
Match: India Vs South Africa 
Venue: Newlands, Cape Town 
Result: South Africa won by 282 runs The visitors were shot out for 100 and 66 in the first Test at Kingsmead, Durban, and a repeat looked well on cards. This until Azhar joined Sachin Tendulkar at the crease. Both the batsmen took on the bowlers and turned the firing the other way. While Azhar played at his carefree best, Sachin was more compact but no less grand.
