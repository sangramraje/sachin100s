Score: 100 N.O. 
Series: Bilateral ODI series, 2007 
Match: India V West Indies, 4th ODI 
Venue: Vadodara 
Result: India won by 160 runs Prior to this game, it was a closely contested ODI series with India winning the first two matches by 14 and 20 runs respectively while the Windies won the 3rd ODI by 3 wickets. It all changed though at Vadodara. India hammered the Windies bowling attack to make a commanding 341 in 50 overs with Sachin becoming the lone centurion scoring exactly a hundred. The Caribbeans were never really in the hunt and eventually folded up for 181 in the 42nd over.
