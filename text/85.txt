Score: 160 
Series: Bilateral test series, 2009 
Match: India V New Zealand, 1st test 
Venue: Hamilton 
Result: India won by 10 wickets It is not often that a team from the sub-continent goes to New Zealand and beats the Kiwis. This Indian team was different. It was full of aggressive cricketers who no more feared the overseas surfaces. New Zealand batted first at Hamilton and made 279. India responded with 520 thanks to Sachin's 160, which had 26 majestic hits to the fence. Trailing by 241, New Zealand fought gallantly in the second essay but were no match to the tough Indians.
