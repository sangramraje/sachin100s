A brilliant year for Sachin Tendulkar ended with another glorious century in the second Test. While Azhar mesmerized everyone in the first innings with a breathtaking hundred, Tendulkar sparkled in the second and helped India post a tricky 213-run fourth innings target. New Zealand was 74-5 but Cairns and McMillan made sure the Kiwis would take a 1-0 lead in the series.
