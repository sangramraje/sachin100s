Century No.55 
Score: 101 
Series: 2001 tri-series in South Africa featuring India, South Africa and Kenya 
Match: India V South Africa, 1st match of the tournament 
Venue: Johannesburg 
Result: South Africa won by 6 wickets It was a thrilling start to the tri-series as India put up a respectable 279 on a good batting wicket at the Wanderers. It could have been a lot higher had the Indian middle order capitalised on a great start provided by Ganguly and Sachin. Both the openers scored centuries and enjoyed a partnership of 193 in just 35 overs. Ironically, South Africa then rode on Sachin's 'guru' to reach 280 with nearly 2 overs to spare. Gary Kirsten made a wonderful 133.
