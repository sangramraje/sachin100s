Century No.67 
Score: 102 
Series: 2003 Tri-series featuring India, Australia and New Zealand 
Match: India V New Zealand, 9th match of the tournament 
Venue: Hyderabad 
Result: India won by 145 runs Lal Bahadur Shastri stadium is easily one of Sachin's favourite venues. Back in 1999, Sachin had killed the kiwi bowling at the same venue on his way to a great knock of 186. And here he was again against the same opponent. This time, it was a lot lesser than 186 since Sehwag was keen to steal the limelight with his 130. Nonetheless, Sachin's century and his opening wicket stand of 182 with Viru took India to a comfortable 145-run over New Zealand.
