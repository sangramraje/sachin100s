Century No.3 
Score: 114 
Match: Australia Vs India 
Series: India in Australia 1992, 5th Test 
Venue: WACA, Perth 
Result: Australia won by 38 runs When most of the batsmen squirmed away from the bouncers and were unable to cope with the extra pace of the Perth wicket, Tendulkar was a picture of concentration and calm. The knock of 114 runs was a classic, and one which is rated supremely by the little master himself.
