Century No.88 
Score: 100 N.O. 
Series: Bilateral test series, 2009 
Match: India V Sri Lanka, 1st test 
Venue: Ahmedabad 
Result: Match drawn It was a match-saving effort from Sachin in a test where most things went wrong for India. The bowlers had conceded a record 760 at home against the Lankans and then had their backs to the wall while trying to avoid the prospect of innings loss. Sachin played out five hours for his century and kept the Lankans spin attack led by Muttiah Muralitharan at bay.
