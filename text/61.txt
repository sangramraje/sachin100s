Century No.61 
Score: 105 N.O. 
Series: 2002 Tri-series in England featuring India, England and Sri Lanka 
Match: India V England, 5th match of the tournament 
Venue: Chester-le-Street 
Result: No result India had begun the tri-series with a bang by beating both England and Sri Lanka in their opening fixtures. Then came this day-night clash at Chester-le-Street. India won the toss and decided to leave the chasing to England. Sachin and Yuvraj blasted the hapless English bowling attack to all parts of the ground on their way to a staggering 170-run partnership. Sachin eased his way to 105 and remained not out at the end of 50 overs. England's chase was halted in the 13th over by the weather Gods and that was it. No result.
