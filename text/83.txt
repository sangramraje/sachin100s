Century No.83 
Score: 103 
Series: Pataudi Trophy, 2008 
Match: India V England, 1st test 
Venue: Chennai 
Result: India won by 6 wickets This was easily one of the most special moments for Sachin in his career. The India-England series had been abruptly called off following the 26/11 Mumbai blasts and when it resumed after a month, Sachin wanted to do something special. He did so in style. India chased down a mammoth 387 in the final inning thanks to great unbeaten 103 by the little master at one of his favourite venues.
