Series: Bilateral ODI series, 2006 
Match: India V Pakistan, 1st ODI 
Venue: Peshawar 
Result: Pakistan won via D/L method After the roaring success of the 2004 tour of Pakistan, the 2006 one was rather difficult for the Indian team. They struggled in the test series but it was a different story in the shorter format. Sachin got a century in the first ODI but India failed to defend 305 from 47 overs. But, the team went on to win the remaining four ODIs in the series to wrap it up 4-1.
