Century No.63 
Score: 193 
Series: Bilateral test series, 2002 
Match: India V England, 3rd test 
Venue: Headingly 
Result: India won by an innings and 46 runs This has to rank among the greatest test victories for India on two counts. First, it came in difficult overseas conditions in England and second, it came when they had their backs to the wall. India notched up 628 for 8 in their first innings with centuries from Dravid, Sachin and Ganguly. The trio never needed to bat again in the test match as Kumble & Co finished off England twice to inflict an innings defeat.
