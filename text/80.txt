Score: 153 
Series: Border-Gavaskar Trophy, 2008 
Match: India V Australia, 4th test 
Venue: Adelaide 
Result: Match drawn India had come into the final test at Adelaide Oval after registering one of their greatest test victories ever. On what is perceived as the fastest wicket in the world, India beat Australia at Perth to get themselves a chance of squaring the series at Adelaide. And their mission began on a sound note with Sachin hammering 153 from just 205 balls (Incredibly fast for test cricket) and India reached 526. Australian batsmen though lived up to their billing and ensured they walked away with a draw in the match and win in the series.
