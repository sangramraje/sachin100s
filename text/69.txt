Century No.69 
Score: 141 
Series: Bilateral ODI series, 2004 
Match: India V Pakistan, 2nd ODI 
Venue: Rawalpindi 
Result: Pakistan won by 12 runs Three days after winning a nail-biter at Lahore, India came into the second ODI at Pindi with confidence on a high. The bowlers allowed that to be punctured somewhat with ordinary effort as Pakistan batsmen, led by top order piled up 329 in 50 overs. India responded in style with Sachin leading from the front with a solid 141. Sachin's knock came from just 135 balls and put India on course for a great win until the middle order failed to come up with the goods. India ended 12 short.
