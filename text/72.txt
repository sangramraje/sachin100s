Century No.72 
Score: 123 
Series: Bilateral ODI series, 2005 
Match: India V Pakistan, 4th ODI 
Venue: Ahmedabad 
Result: Pakistan won by 3 wickets The series was well poised after India won the first match at Vizag and Pakistan responded with a win at Jamshedpur. India won the toss and batted first. Sachin blasted 123 off 130 balls as India raced to 315, which on most surfaces is a match-winning one. Pakistan had other ideas though with almost everyone at the top of the order contributing their bit. It was a close contest but the men from across the border emerged triumphant.
