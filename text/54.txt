Century No.54 
Score: 122 
Series: 2001 tri-series in Zimbabwe featuring Zimbabwe, India and West Indies 
Match: India V West Indies, 6th match of preliminary stage 
Venue: Harare 
Result: India won by 6 wickets This match was seen as a dress rehearsal before the final as both India and West Indies had already booked their place in the summit clash. Indian bowlers had done a very good job of restricting the West Indies to a less-than-competitive 229 in their allotted 50 overs. Buoyed by a brisk opening stand of 133 between Sachin and Ganguly, India made the task look easy. Sachin went to score his century at a run-a-ball and guide India to a comfortable win.
