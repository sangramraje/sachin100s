Century No.73 
Score: 109 
Series: Bilateral test series, 2005 
Match: India V Sri Lanka, 2nd test 
Venue: Delhi 
Result: India won by 188 runs Sachin was the lone centurion in the test, which was in the balance for long periods before India marched ahead in the late stages. India depended on Sachin's patient 109 (took 5 hours) to muster 290 in their first essay. Sri Lanka failed to capitalise on a good start to their chase and collapsed from 175 for 2 to just 230 all out. That turned the match on its head and India finished as the winning side.
