Century No.52 
Score: 126 
Series: Border-Gavaskar Trophy, 2001 
Match: India V Australia, 3rd test 
Venue: Chennai 
Result: India won by 2 wickets This match was in many ways an exhibition of test cricket. The series was levelled 1-1 before the Chennai test and when Australia put up 391 in their first innings thanks to Mathew Hayden's double hundred, they were in a very strong position. All this changed once Sachin came out to bat and scored a majestic 126 to help India surpass the 500-run mark. India never really looked back from there and despite a lion-hearted effort by Jason Gillespie, India won the match by 2 wickets.
