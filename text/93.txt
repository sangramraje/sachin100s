Century No.93 
Score: 200 N.O. 
Series: Bilateral ODI series, 2010 
Match: India V South Africa, 2nd ODI 
Venue: Gwalior 
Result: India won by 153 runs The greatest ODI inning of all time. When Saeed Anwar reached 194, many had thought cricket will have to wait for generations for that record to be broken. The wait was there but not for that long. When the record was broken, it was the sweetest moment for Sachin and Indian cricket. Sachin's 200 and India's 401 will be remembered forever.
