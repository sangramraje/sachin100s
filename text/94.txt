Century No.94 
Score: 203 
Series: Bilateral test series, 2010 
Match: India V Sri Lanka, 2nd test 
Venue: SSC, Colombo 
Result: Match drawn It was a gritty effort from the little master and came when the team was under pressure. Sri Lanka had notched up 642 on an excellent batting surface and when India was reduced to 241 for 4, there were chances of a follow-on. That's when Sachin and Raina took control and thwarted Lankan aspirations. Sachin scored a doubled hundred in nearly 9 hours of great concentration.
