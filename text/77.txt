Century No.77 
Score: 101 
Series: Bilateral test series, 2007 
Match: India V Bangladesh, 1st test 
Venue: Chittagong 
Result: Match drawn It was a rain-hit test match where India called the shots for long periods but lack of time made a result impossible. India batted first and made 387 with centuries from Sachin and Ganguly. Sachin's inning was a painstaking effort lasting nearly 5 hours. It was very unlike Sachin but who cares. It is the end number that matters in cricket.
