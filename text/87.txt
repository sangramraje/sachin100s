Century No.87 
Score: 175 
Series: Bilateral ODI series, 2009 
Match: India V Australia, 5th ODI 
Venue: Hyderabad (Rajiv Gandhi stadium) 
Result: Australia won by 3 runs Chasing down an improbable 351, India fought all the way through and was even ahead of the Aussies at many stages during the chase. This was largely due to Sachin's magnificent inning of 175 where he single-handedly demolished the Aussie bowling attack. The sad part was he got out just when he shouldn't have and India lost momentum to eventually lose the match by just 3 runs.
