Century No.58 
Score: 103 
Series: Bilateral test series, 2001 
Match: India V England , 2nd test 
Venue: Ahmedabad 
Result: Match drawn It was a very patient knock by the little master on a fairly difficult track and under pressure. England had batted first at Motera and notched up a competitive 407 with very useful contributions coming from batsmen down the order. Indian batsmen struggled against the left-arm spin of Ashley Giles but Sachin ensured the damage would be limited. His knock took so much time off the test that England couldn't press home for a win. India retained their 1-0 lead.
