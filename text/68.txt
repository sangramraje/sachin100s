Century No.68 
Score: 241 N.O. 
Series: Border-Gavaskar Trophy, 2004 
Match: India V Australia, 4th test 
Venue: Sydney 
Result: Match drawn It was an epic clash at the SCG and it had an epic performance from an epic cricketer. Sachin Tendulkar blasted his first hundred of the series and what a knock it was. It helped India shatter many records while racing to 705 for 7 against the mighty Aussies. It needed a combination of poor umpiring and gritty Steve Waugh to ensure Australia would walk away with a draw. Sachin's knock was laced with 33 hits to the boundary and lasted more than 10 hours. What concentration!
