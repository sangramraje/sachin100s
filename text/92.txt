Century No.92 
Score: 106 
Series: Bilateral test series, 2010 
Match: India V South Africa, 2nd test 
Venue: Kolkata 
Result: India won by an innings and 57 runs It is never easy to bounce back in test cricket after facing an innings defeat only a few days back. But, India did just that in style at Eden Gardens. Sachin was the lone warrior at Nagpur but he had many for support at Kolkata. After bowling out South Africa for under 300, India rallied on four centurions including Sachin's 106 to reach 643 and that was it.
