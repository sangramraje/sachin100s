Century No.78 
Score: 122 N.O. 
Series: Bilateral test series, 2007 
Match: India V Bangladesh, 2nd test 
Venue: Mirpur 
Result: India won by an innings and 239 runs If weather Gods saved Bangladesh in the first test, the next one at Mirpur exposed the gap between Bangladesh and the rest of test-playing nations. It wasn't just a defeat. It was an embarrassment for the Bangladeshis. The top four batsmen in the batting order for India all scored centuries and that included Sachin's unbeaten 122. The combined first and second innings totals of Bangladesh still fell short of follow on par score of 410!
