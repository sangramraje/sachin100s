A tragic hundred from Tendulkar. All hope was lost, and then Mongia and Tendulkar struck a crucial partnership, bringing India close to Pakistan's target. Fighting a bad back and incisive bowling from the likes of Wasim, Waqar and Saqlain Mustaq, Tendulkar fell when India were 17 runs short of the target. India lost the match by 12 runs.
