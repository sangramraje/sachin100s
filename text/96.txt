Century No.96 
Score: 111 N.O. 
Series: Bilateral test series, 2010 
Match: India V South Africa, 1st test 
Venue: Centurion 
Result: South Africa won by an innings and 25 runs It was an inauspicious start for India to their 'final frontier' campaign. Batting first on damp Centurion wicket, India folded up for just 136. The Proteas then carved out 620 thanks to a double hundred by Kallis and two other centurions. India then tried hard to hang in for a draw but the task was way too enormous. Sachin fought in vain with his 50th test century but that was the only takeaway from an otherwise miserable match.
